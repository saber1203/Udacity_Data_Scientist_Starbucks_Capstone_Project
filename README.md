# Udacity_Data_Scientist_Starbucks_Capstone_Project
Make recommendation system for Starbucks Offer

## Project Overview
This project is Udacity Starbucks Capstone Challenge in Data Scientist Course. I made a machine learning model which predicted offer completed for each customer based on user profiels, offer portfolio and transcript data. Based on the ML model, I made a recommendation web application for Starbucks on how to recommend offer to a user.

## Data Overview
There are three json datasets provided by Udacity, these data sets contain simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. 
1. portfolio.json — containing offer ids and meta data about each offer (duration, type, etc.)
2. profile.json — demographic data for each customer
3. transcript.json — records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed
